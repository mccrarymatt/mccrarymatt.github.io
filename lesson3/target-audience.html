        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>
            Our audience consists of both individuals and families ranging from teens to 
            older adults who are interested in outdoor activities and events that can 
            be impacted by the weather. They may be local residents who are interested
            in how the weather is affecting their community or they could be visitors
            interested in local attractions and events. Both will will ultimately want
            to know how the weather will impact their own plans and how it is impacting
            the events and places locally.

            "We'll need to get an early start tomorrow if we're going to make it back before the storm rolls in" - Sam
            <br><br>
            Sam is a local guide for backpackers knowing the weather is essential 
            to his work and knowing what sort of plans to make for those he guides.
            He'll often make plans in advance for those he's intending to lead and knowing the weather
            in advance is an important factor in wether to take a break or head home for the day.
            Beyond that he's a young father who likes using his knowledge of nature and the area
            to go on camping trips with his family so the outdoors is just as much a part of his
            recreation as it is work.

            "That flower's only native to this area so I'd like to take a closer look." - Sarah 
            <br><br>

            She's single and looking forward to the chance to relax without having to worry about work.
            Knowing how the weather might impact some of the places she want's to visit will play a major factor
            in what she decides to do for the day and even though she's not here for the plants that doesn't
            mean her natural curiosity will be sated wether here to relax or work it's the outdoors that
            brought her here in the first place.
