        <h3>A Day to Remember</h3>
        <h4>by Matthew McCrary</h4>
        <p>This weekend after rather long and hectic work week I was greeted, very surprisingly, by some of my friends who had apparently decided that due to the wonderful weather forecasted this weekend that we were all going camping. Everything had been prepared and planned ahead and it didn't seem as though I had much of a chance to decline. </p>
        <p>Thankfully in spite of some reluctance on my part I decided to not resist and go along with this adventure that had been planned. Coming back to it now I am truly glad that I went along. When it came down to it the trip really was just an overnight stay in the woods so who was I to really argue. I was fortunate however that the weather really was wonderful with the sunny skies but still brisk temperature. It really made it easy to cool down in the shade and warm up standing in the sun.</p>
        <p>The day made me feel very grateful to live in the area and helped give me the chance to appreciate the beauty of the surrounding woods. The air was crisp the plants were vibrant and it really felt like I was better off for being there. I'm really grateful to the friends who knew that I needed to get away that weekend even if it was just for a night because when it comes down to it the experience was something I don't think I'll soon forget. All in all it was truly a day to remember.</p>
