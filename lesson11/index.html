        <h3>Good News for the Coming Months</h3>
        <h4>by Matthew McCrary</h4>
        <p>The sun is shining and the birds are singing, today at least, and maybe for some time to come at least more than normal it seems. Thanks to some of the current trends in the weather and some other data that has been compiled it's looking like we're going to be in for some pretty nice weather in the coming months.</p>
        <p>While it is only a current prediction and certainly subject to change current meteorologist predictions leave us having some fairly cool but largely sunny days ahead of us for this coming spring and even into summer a bit. Even if it doesn't turn out to be that way the news itself is certainly a reason to consider getting outdoors a bit more in the future, maybe even taking a hike on some trails.</p>
        <p>If nothing else going out into nature and having the weather take an unexpected turn would certainly be a story to tell and at the least you'd have someone to blame a burden which I'll gladly bear I might add. There's a lot that could be said regarding it being a bit to early to tell this far in advance what the next few months will bring especially with how unpreditable things have seemed in other areas but it's my personal opinion that as long as the odds are in your favour it shouldn't hurt to much make some plans even if they don't turn out exactly as expected it'll likely be worth the memories, and when it comes down to it isn't thats what's important? Not always?<br><br> Oh well it was worth a shot if all else fails just know I'm wishing you some good fortune for the coming months.</p>
