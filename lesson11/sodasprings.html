        <h3>A Trip Into the Mountains</h3>
        <h4>by Matthew McCrary</h4>
        <p>To those of you who don't know I'm something of a hiker in that I occasionally enjoy a hike if it's a good day and I'm allowed to turn back whenever I wish. All of that aside however I decided to enjoy the recent weather by taking a trip into the mountains with some of my family. When it comes down to it the experience really made me glad that there are some aspects of nature that we can still turn to and enjoy. Don't get me wrong of course I enjoy civilization and the comforts of modern life, perhaps a bit more than I enjoy nature even, but it's nice to at least have the opportuity to go out into nature for a bit.</p>
        <p>Even if my personal trips into the wilds are rather short and infrequent they do often offer me the chance to be a bit introspective and think about things I might normally not really consider all that much. When it comes down to it I also know that the view of the mountains creates a sort of majesty that the wonders we've created ourselves really can't compare to. Maybe that'll be something that changes in the future but for the moment I think a trip outdoors is something that everyone could use every once in a while at least to get some inspiration that you can really feel and take back with you.</p>
        <p>So yes while I'm at it this article might just be a simple, hey guess what my weekend was great! It's also an invitation to anyone reading to just consider taking some time out of your busy lives to take a brief step into the outdoors and see what sort of seed you can bring back with you to grow in your own mental garden if you will. After all there are other's who might not have the chance to see some of the sights that we have right here so it'd be a shame to not use the opportunity right?</p>
